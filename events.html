                <h3>Talk Cafe</h3>
                <p>
                  GirlUp Ludhiana has always tried to increase the talk about
                  issues that are considered a taboo and have tried to normalise
                  & increase the awareness about the same.
                  <br />
                  So in our venture uplift women and society Girl up Ludhiana
                  partnered with Aiesec Ludhiana to host the event called The
                  TalkCafe to raise the thoughts on the topic of Mental Health
                  As unique as the name the TalkCafe, the event highlighted that
                  people already have within them the wisdom and creativity to
                  confront even the most difficult challenges, the answers we
                  need are available to us and we are wiser together than we are
                  alone.
                  <br />
                  The event was a huge success as people from different walks of
                  life shared their experiences with mental health. It was a
                  progressive discussion that talked about how and why it is of
                  utmost importance to prioritise mental health above everything
                  else.

                  to GirlUp Ludhiana
                  <br />On our journey to amplify the unheard voices of women we
                  held our third webinar of rubaroo on the issue “Role of women
                  in the society and breaking stereotypes about women” in order
                  to provide every girl with a safe platform to share their
                  experiences.<br />
                  It was conducted with a very special and versatile guest Mr.
                  Avi Vatsa. Another thing that made this rubaroo webinar even
                  more remarkable was the fact that girlUp Ludhiana collaborated
                  with, GirlUp Muskurahat, GirlUp Boundless, GirlUp Womanite,
                  GirlUp Kushi, GirlUp Aujasya, GirlUp Avyanna, GirlUp Sheroars

                <p>
                  Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of
                  the present without compromising the ability of future
                  generations to meet their own needs. <br />
                  Girl-Up Ludhiana took a step forward to spread this word ,
                  that also in a unique way. All the Members opted for their
                  goals and then what , camera rolling - sound - action !!
                  <br />Members of various departments presented their
                  viewpoints on the respective goal and all solutions to curb it
                  by taking little steps in our day to day lives. <br />This
                  initiative proved to be a big success for the team and it also
                  got recognised by GIRLUP CAMPAIGN , officially.<br />
                  It's high time to tutor ourselves now and save the planet
                  earth's pristine form, so we can give our coming generations a
                  safer, cleaner and of course better place to breathe in.

                <p>
                  The Rotary International is a widely recognized Non-Profit
                  organization, a club of which is situated in Ludhiana.
                  Volunteers from the same and GirlUp Ludhiana were honored to
                  be called for a visit to Ekjot Viklang School for Diwali
                  Celebrations. Vibrant hues and vivacity filled the atmosphere
                  as the students decorated the place with rangolis and
                  participated in a zesty Diya painting contest. The festival of
                  Diwali called for goodness and positivity. So, in its spirit,
                  the volunteers distributed drawing books, stationary kits and
                  chocolate packs among the children. The event had a musical
                  conclusion with three blind artists leaving everyone
                  spellbound. The visit emphasized the importance of kindness
                  and compassion for everyone present and we wish to be able to
                  spread more joy in the future.

                <p>
                  GirlUp Ludhiana collaborated with Girlup India to work on
                  'Project Period' - a month-long campaign that pushed for
                  sustainable menstrual health practices, raised funds for the
                  purpose and also advocated for including that in the national
                  guidelines. Girlup Ludhiana was provided this opportunity by
                  Girlup India to become a part of this project and for its
                  active advocacy on menstruation related awareness. A lot of
                  work was done through our social media handles to spread
                  awareness during this project.
